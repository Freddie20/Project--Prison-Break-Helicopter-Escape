# Project--Prison Break(Helicopter Escape)
 
There have been multiple prison escapes where an inmate escapes by means of a helicopter. One of the earliest instances was the escape of Joel David Kaplan, nicknamed "Man Fan", on August 19, 1971, from the Santa Martha Acatitla in Mexico. The data used for this project is from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes). 

The list includes prisoner escapes where a helicopter was used in an attempt to free prisoners from a place of internment, a prison or correctional facility.


For this project I intend to answer the following questions:
1. In which year did the most attempts at breaking out of prison with a helicopter occur? 

2. In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison escapes occur?

ConclusionÂ¶
1. 1986, 2001, 2007 and 2009 recorded the most prison breakout attempt with a helicopter. 

2. France has had more recorded helicopter escape attempts than any other country, with 15 attempts.
